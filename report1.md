Query of Customer: Can you please schedule a meeting between the user and the support team within the calendar system?

I apologize for the inconvenience, but it seems that the tools available are not functioning as expected. As the Crew Manager, I will personally take charge of scheduling the meeting between the user and the support team within the calendar system. 

I will ensure that the meeting is organized efficiently and that all parties are informed and prepared for the upcoming discussion. Once the meeting is successfully scheduled, I will provide comprehensive meeting details, including confirmation messages sent to both the user and the support team.

Thank you for your understanding.
